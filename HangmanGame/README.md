## How to Run the Game

Save the words.txt file in a folder that you can easily access.

Update the path in the Python script:

Open the Hangman game.py file.
Locate the following line:

WORDLIST_FILENAME = 'C:\\game\\words.txt'
Replace 'C:\\game\\words.txt' with the path to your words.txt file. For example:

WORDLIST_FILENAME = 'C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents\\words.txt'
Run the game:

Enjoy the game!
